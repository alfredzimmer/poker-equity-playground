# TO-DO

1. Adding practice mode for users: given a random hand and a decision, the user would need to work out their expected value to determine whether they should make the call; user can also log in to store history practices and view their accuracy.
2. Add `Zustand` for global state control.
3. Rewrite Cactus Kev's Algorithm using WASM to maximize efficiency.
